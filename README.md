we evaluate machine learning models on a dataset using k-fold cross-validation, To correctly apply nearest neighbors missing data imputation and avoid data leakage, This can be achived by creating a modeling pipeline
where the first step is the nearest neighbors imputation, then the second step is the model, we were implement this using the pipeline class.
